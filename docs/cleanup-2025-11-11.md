# Cleanup summary (2025-11-11)

## Removed legacy Vite client bundle
- Deleted `src/App.jsx`, `src/app.css`, and `src/main.jsx` which belonged to the unused Vite prototype UI.
- No build scripts reference these files and the production Next.js app uses the `app/` directory, so the legacy files were unreferenced.

## Removed unused client TTS helper
- Deleted `lib/tts.ts`; the helper was not imported anywhere in the current Next.js surface.
- The remaining audio pipeline relies on `lib/session-recorder.ts` and `lib/audio-bridge.ts` for capture/playback.

These removals shrink the bundle surface and prevent accidental drift between the maintained Next.js implementation and the historical prototype.
